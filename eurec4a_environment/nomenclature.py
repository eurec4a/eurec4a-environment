"""
To ensure that all functions in eurec4a-environment can access the variables
required the module uses a common nomenclature for variable names throughout.
To add a new variable to the nomenclature simply a) add a new constant below
setting the assumed field name and b) add (if available) the CF-conventions
standard name mapping in `CF_STANDARD_NAMES` if the variable has a "standard
name" (See http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html for the list of
"standard names")
